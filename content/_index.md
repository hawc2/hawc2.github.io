Hi, I'm testing out building a professional website from scratch. This is a work in progress. Visit www.alexwermercolan.com for my primary website.

## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/headshot.png" alt="headshot">}}

I am a writer, editor, and translator. I also work as a volunteer as the Administrative Lead of the Philly Community Wireless project. 

For my day job, I work as a Digital Scholarship Coordinator in Temple University Libraries' Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio. 

## Professional Background 

My scholarly and creative interests always circle around the intersection of politics, aesthetics, and technology. 

I think of much of my work in terms of translation, no matter if I am editing books of scholarly criticism and literary history, curating rare archival materials with emerging technologies for web and immersive visualization, and working as a dramaturg to adapt fiction to new media theatrical performances, or translating French poetry into English. I am always concerned with how issues of power and social justice impeded access to information and culture in all its forms is instrumental to the decline in social infrastructure and the environment today.
