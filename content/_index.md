Hi, I'm testing out building a professional website from scratch. This is a work in progress. Visit www.alexwermercolan.com for my primary website.

## About Me

{{< figure class="headshot" src="/headshot.jpg" alt="headshot">}}

I am a writer, editor, and translator. I work at Temple University as a Digital Scholarship Coordinator in TU Libraries' Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio. 

In my professional and artistic work, my primary interests remain at the intersection of politics, aesthetics, and technology.

My interests in translation span many forms of critical and creative, including editing books of scholarly criticism and literary history, curating rare archival materials with emerging technologies for web and immersive visualization, and working as a dramaturg to adapt fiction to new media theatrical performances.
