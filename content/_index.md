Hi, I'm testing out building a professional website from scratch. This is a work in progress. Visit www.alexwermercolan.com for my primary website.

## About Me

{{< figure class="headshot" src="/headshot.jpg" alt="headshot">}}

I am a writer, editor, and translator. I also work at as a Digital Scholarship Coordinator in Temple University Libraries' Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio. 

My research and creative interests circle around the intersection of politics, aesthetics, and technology. I think of much of my work in terms of translation, no matter if I am editing books of scholarly criticism and literary history, curating rare archival materials with emerging technologies for web and immersive visualization, and working as a dramaturg to adapt fiction to new media theatrical performances, or translating French poetry into English.
