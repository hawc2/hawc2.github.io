Hi, I'm testing out building a professional website from scratch. This is a work in progress. Visit www.alexwermercolan.com for my primary website.

I am a writer, editor, and translator. I work at Temple University as a Digital Scholarship Coordinator in TU Libraries' Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio. In my professional and creative work, my primary interests remain at the intersection of politics, aesthetics, and technology.
