> Let a little less last - Gertrude Stein

## Introductions

Hi, I'm testing out building a professional website from scratch. This is a work in progress. Visit www.alexwermercolan.com for my primary website.

## About Me

I am a writer, editor, and translator. I also work as a volunteer as the Administrative Lead of the Philly Community Wireless project.

For my day job, I work as a Digital Scholarship Coordinator in Temple University Libraries' Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio.

## Professional Background

My scholarly and creative interests always circle around the intersection of politics, aesthetics, and technology.

I think of my work in terms of translation, no matter if I am writing, editing, curating, working as a dramaturg, or translating French literature into English. I am always concerned with how issues of power and social justice impede access to information and culture, and how these failures and limitations to communication has become instrumental to the decline in social infrastructure and the global environment today.

I work on projects that involve artistic interventions into political issues, from a critical vantage point, as well as towards reparative ending, remediating marginalized archival materials, documenting neglected works of art, or contributing to the growth of a community-owned wireless internet network.

## Portfolio

My creative work represented here ranges from translation of literary works to their adaptation for the theater.
